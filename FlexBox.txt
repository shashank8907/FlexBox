What is flex box?

-It is also called flexible box model.
-It is basically a layout mode/model that provides easy and clean way to 
arrange items in a container

-CSS widths, floats to arrange items on the page eg: three boxes on the row. the factor in the margin, padding, borders and it can all be taken care of by flexbox
------------------------------------------
Benfits of using Flexbox:
-There's no floats at all.
-It's responsive, mobile friendly.
-You can you use it for media query.
-Positioning child elements is much easier. 
-Flex container's margin do not collapse with the margins of it's contents. 
-Order of the elements can easily be changed without editing 
the source HTML
------------------------------------------
Concepts of flexbox:
-The ability to alter item within height and width to best fit in it's container's
available free space.
-Flexbox is direction-agnostic(This is different than CSS block model which is vertically biased and inline which is horizontally biased. Flexbox works well for both)
-Flexbox was intially created for small-scale layouts while the upcomming "Grid"
specification is for large scale.This "Grid" system works
